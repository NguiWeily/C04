• Create a function that counts and returns the number of characters in a string.
• Here’s how it should be prototyped :
int ft_strlen(char *str);

Certainly! Here's an implementation of the `ft_strlen` function that counts and returns the number of characters in a string:

```c
int ft_strlen(char *str)
{
    int length = 0;

    while (*str)
    {
        length++;
        str++;
    }

    return length;
}
```

In this implementation, the `ft_strlen` function takes a pointer to a null-terminated string `str` as its parameter.

The function uses a while loop to iterate through the characters of the string. It increments the `length` variable for each character encountered in the string by dereferencing the `str` pointer and incrementing it. The loop continues until the null terminator (`'\0'`) is reached, indicating the end of the string.

Once the loop completes, the function returns the value of the `length` variable, which represents the number of characters in the string.

Please note that this implementation assumes that the input string is null-terminated, as is the convention in C.
